Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed,
to form larger structures.

The structural design patterns simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships.

These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed
from other classes.

These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form
larger structures and provide new functionality.

Bridge Pattern
Bridge pattern decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

Composite Pattern
Allowing clients to operate on hierarchy of objects.

Decorator Pattern
Adding functionality to an object dynamically.
